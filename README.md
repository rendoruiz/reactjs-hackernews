Learning React the fun way by messing around with the Hacker News API. 

## Usage

- [Deployed website](https://old.news.knkd.app/) for general viewing.
- `npm install` to install npm dependencies.
- `npm start` to test the project locally.
- `npm run build` to build the project for deployment.

## Goals

- Build a SPA using the Hacker News API
- Learn how to use CSS Modules
- Be better at using React.js, modern JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

## Scope and Limitations

- Story comment links are currently not supported.
- Do not use the browser inspector to look up CSS properties when copying designs on Reddit.
- Content will be limited to story and comment. 
- Partial poll support: Poll submissions are only accessible from the comment card on the user page. The poll elements are not rendered, but the HTML text is still available for context.
- A commented URL is provided on code copied online with little to no modifications.
- Loaders (i.e., "Loading...") are displayed as it is (plain text).
- Further performance optimizations are not a priority.
- Partial mobile Reddit layout support: The site is responsive, but does not fully emulate the Reddit mobile experience.
- No tests.
